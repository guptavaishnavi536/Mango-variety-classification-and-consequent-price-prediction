# Mango-variety-classification-and-consequent-price-prediction

The aim of this project is to predict the variety of the mango from an image given as input by the user and based on this classification subsequently identifying the modal price of the mango. The entire project is divided into 3 python files. The first python file uses the test image as input, the second part uses the csv file as input and the third uses the test image or any image of the user's preference.
